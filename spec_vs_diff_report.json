  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive full-stack restaurant application with most requirements addressed. The backend (backend/main.mo) contains a single Motoko actor with all required data types and functions. The frontend includes all major screens. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps: the saved delivery addresses feature in Profile is simplified to a single address field rather than add/remove multiple addresses; the Home screen Today's Special section uses static promo cards rather than backend-driven dish cards in a horizontal scroll; the Admin revenue report grouping by day is unconfirmed; and image assets are referenced in code but their actual file presence is unconfirmed due to omitted files.",

      "reason": "The Profile page and ProfileSetupModal use a single 'address' string field in UserProfile. There is no multi-address add/remove functionality — just one address that can be edited. REQ-9 requires users to add and remove saved delivery addresses as a list.",
